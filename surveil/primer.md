# Introduction

**Surveillance State** is a fun and surprisingly fair reanimator deck built around **surveil** and Mirko’s ability to raise the dead—with a sinister twist. Death is only the beginning.

## Keywords

- **Surveil** — *Look at the top N cards of your library, then put any number of them into your graveyard and the rest back on top in any order.*
- **Finality counter** — *If a permanent with a finality counter on it would die, exile it instead.*

# The Commander

[[Mirko, Obsessive Theorist]] is a blue/black 1/3 flying, vigilant vampire who gets a +1/+1 counter whenever you **surveil**. At your end step, Mirko can return a creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield—as long as its power is less than theirs.

But creatures reanimated by Mirko come back with **finality counters**, meaning they can't cheat death again, unless you find a way to remove those counters...

Use surveil to load your graveyard with reanimation targets. As Mirko’s power grows, they’ll bring back bigger and scarier threats, eventually leading an army of undead horrors—with themselves as a towering, ever-hovering champion.

## The Lieutenant

[[Y'shtola Rhul]] is your feline partner in graveyard muckery, giving you an additional end step each turn. That means Mirko gets to reanimate **two** nightmarish creatures instead of one. Plus, Y'shtola’s _flicker_ ability (exile and return a creature) removes finality counters, making her a key piece in your death-and-rebirth engine.

Although it would be great to have Mirko reanimate a creature and Y'shtola remove the finality counter from it all at once, that isn’t possible. Y'shtola’s ability says _“exile **target** creature you control,”_ and all targets for an ability must be chosen when the ability goes on the stack—before Mirko’s reanimated creature is even on the battlefield.

**BUT!** Y'shtola gives us another end step.

So here's what we can do:

At your end step, both Mirko and Y'shtola’s abilities trigger. If there’s already a creature on the battlefield with a finality counter, target that one with Y'shtola’s flicker ability. Otherwise, you can target Y'shtola herself to avoid having to flicker Mirko—especially if Mirko already has +1/+1 counters you don't want to lose. The flickered creature will exile and return to the battlefield **without** the finality counter. Then, use Mirko’s trigger to reanimate a new creature.

Then Y'shtola's if clause triggers giving you an additional end step.  During that second end step, Mirko and Y'shtola trigger again. This time, Y'shtola can target the creature Mirko reanimated during the first end step, flickering it and removing its finality counter.

**Result:** Two reanimated creatures, but only one of them keeps the finality counter!

# The Gameplan

## Early Game — Fill the Grave

Start the game with a card that surveils, loots (*draw then discard*), or draws. Ramping isn’t as important here as card advantage and graveyard setup.

Surveil aggressively. Unless it’s a land you need immediately, send it to the graveyard—you can get it back later.

Cast Mirko as soon as possible and surveil every turn if you can. **Don't forget their end step trigger**—it’s a *may* ability and easy to miss. Start attacking with them right away. Their evasion, vigilance, and high toughness make them a reliable early source of commander damage that can pay off later.

While Mirko’s power is still small, focus on cheap value creatures like [[Baleful Strix]], [[Accursed Marauder]], and [[Mulldrifter]] (evoked), which make great early reanimation targets. Also prioritize low-cost, repeatable surveil effects like [[Gossip's Talent]], [[Watcher of Hours]], and [[Search for Azcanta]]—these both fuel your graveyard and grow Mirko.

## Mid Game — Surveil, Attack, Reanimate

### Bring Out Your Dead

By now, Mirko should be threatening enough to draw removal. That’s fine—Mirko shouldn’t be your only threat.

By turn 6 or 7, you should be reanimating heavy hitters like [[Doom Whisperer]], [[Grave Titan]], and [[Massacre Wurm]]. Force your opponents to make hard decisions with their removal. Keep the pressure on.

If Mirko dies, just recast them—they only cost 3 mana. Or better yet, reanimate **them** with [[Reanimate]], [[Victimize]], or [[Restart Sequence]]!

### Unfinalize Death

To get repeated value from your threats, you’ll need to remove their finality counters.

You have two ways to "unfinalize" creatures:

- **Counter-removal tools** like [[Nesting Grounds]], [[Fain, the Broker]], and [[Hexavus]]  
- **Flicker effects** like [[Y'shtola Rhul]], [[Conjurer's Closet]], and [[Meneldor, Swift Savior]]

Use these to remove finality counters from your strongest reanimated creatures so they can continue looping in and out of the grave.

### Clone Army

Mirko will attract removal, and when they come back, their power resets to 1. Enter the **clones**.

Cards like [[Phyrexian Metamorph]], [[Clever Impersonator]], and [[Spark Double]] have 0 power in the graveyard—making them valid targets for reanimation. When they hit the field, they can copy your most terrifying threat already on the battlefield or in the graveyard.

## End Game — Make Death Final

If you’ve made it to the late game with Mirko still around, you likely have a massive flying vampire. Go for the win with commander damage and an overwhelming board.

Even if Mirko’s been dealt with, your field should be frightening enough to close the game with cards like [[Gray Merchant of Asphodel]], [[Twilight Prophet]], or [[Massacre Wurm]]—possibly even in multiples from your clones.

# Summary

Surveillance State is a flexible reanimator deck that rewards careful sequencing and patient setup. Whether you’re filling your graveyard with surveil effects, looping creatures back to the battlefield, or growing Mirko into a towering, evasive threat, every turn offers interesting decisions.

Between powerful finishers, clever counter-removal tools, and the extra end steps Y'shtola provides, you’ll find no shortage of ways to overwhelm your opponents. If you enjoy a blend of graveyard value, combo potential, and Voltron commander damage, this deck offers a satisfying and sinister path to victory.
