# Introduction  

Inspired by Salubrious Snail's buff spells [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/8m-BcgDND_Q), this is a spellslinger deck that focuses on combat tricks and creature buffs—no wheels here.

**Combative Snakes** is easy and fun to play, sitting somewhere between a bracket 2 and 3 deck depending on how you pilot it. Since most of your tools stay hidden in your hand, you can adjust your power level on the fly—no one needs to know just how dangerous you really are.

# The Commander  

[[Xyris, the Writhing Storm]] is a 3/5 flying Snake that creates a 1/1 green Snake token whenever an opponent draws a card *outside* of their draw step. And when Xyris deals combat damage to a player, *you and that player* each draw that many cards—meaning you create that many snakes. Lovely!

## The Lieutenant  

[[Ohran Frostfang]] slithers right into Xyris’s gameplan. This 2/6 Snake gives your attackers deathtouch and lets you draw cards when they deal combat damage. Suddenly, your 1/1 snakes become deadly little saboteurs.

# The Gameplan

## Early Game — Ramp and Sabotage 

The opening game follows a classic green plan: ramp and fix your mana base with spells like [[Farseek]], [[Kodama's Reach]], and [[Skyshroud Claim]]. Cards like [[Professional Face-Breaker]] and [[Tireless Provisioner]] that generate Treasure tokens also help stabilize your mana and provide useful resources later in the game.

Alongside ramp, play a saboteur (a creature that draws when it deals combat damage) like [[Mischievous Catgeist]], [[Cold-Eyed Selkie]], or [[Enduring Curiosity]]. Or a pinger (a creature that deals damage when you cast a spell) like [[Electrostatic Field]] or [[Firebrand Archer]]. These help you chip away at life totals while keeping your hand full.

## Mid Game — Who Wants Cards?  

Now's the time to cast Xyris—ideally with a protection spell in hand like [[Royal Treatment]], [[Shore Up]], or [[Gaea's Gift]]. If he dies early, he gets expensive fast, and protection sends a message to the table: “Don’t waste your removal—Xyris is untouchable.”

Xyris *looks* scary. Counter that perception by not buffing him unless you have a reason. Sell his combat damage as a bargain: “3 life for 3 cards? That’s a deal!” This builds trust with your opponents. Just be careful who you attack—don't feed cards to the player who's already ahead.

Xyris tends to draw you more cards than you can play, and your hand will quickly exceed the seven-card limit. That’s intentional. A full hand looks threatening, but discarding every turn *looks* like you're losing value. In reality, you’re sculpting a perfect hand each turn, tailored for your needs.

By the end of the mid-game, you’ll likely have a small snake army. Keep your snakes back—treat them as surprise blockers. A 1/1 becomes a 4/4 with a [[Giant Growth]] and can swing combat in your favor when least expected.

---

## End Game — Math is for Blockers  

Xyris shines when at least one opponent is out of the game. Until then, lay low and wait.

Once someone’s been eliminated, go on the offensive. Use smaller buff spells like [[Giant Growth]], [[Mutagenic Growth]], [[Monstrous Rage]], or [[Overprotect]] to push Xyris close to lethal. Ironically, it’s *better* to leave an opponent alive after a huge swing—so you still get the cards and snakes from the damage. Just choose your target wisely: don’t hand a combo player their win condition.

If you’ve got [[Overpowering Attack]] in hand, you can do it all over again—but this time, don’t hold back.

Speaking of which, with one player dead, another limping, and the third cowering—it’s time to go full snake mode. Play your anthem cards like [[Beastmaster Ascension]], [[Combine Chrysalis]], or [[Banner of Kinship]], then swing with everything. Keep mana open and a counterspell ready—[[Negate]], [[Simic Charm]], or [[Long River’s Pull]]—to stop any last-ditch answers.

Once blockers are declared, whatever gets through gets **HUGE**. Buff freely with [[Become Immense]], [[Get a Leg Up]], [[Might of the Masses]], [[Strength in Numbers]], [[Temur Battle Rage]], and more. This is your moment—dump your hand if you need to. End it.

# Summary  

Combative Snakes is one of my absolute favorite decks to play, thanks to its interactive playstyle, clever politics, and explosive finishers. It thrives on keeping your true strength hidden until just the right moment—then suddenly overwhelming the table with a swarm of buffed-up snakes and a massive draw engine.

You’re constantly engaging with the board, the stack, and your opponents’ expectations. You’re never truly out of the game as long as you have cards in hand and a few mana open. It rewards timing, bluffing, and knowing when to strike.

The best part? You control the pace. Depending on how aggressive or subtle you play, this deck can easily shift between a casual bracket 2 meta and a more tuned bracket 3 environment. Play low and political, or burst out of nowhere with a lethal strike—the power is in your hands, hidden until the perfect moment.

If you like combat math, bluffing with buff spells, and the satisfying rhythm of baiting removal before going all-in, then Combative Snakes might just slither its way into your favorites too.
