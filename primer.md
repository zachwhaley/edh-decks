# Introduction

**The Fungi** is not just a graveyard deck.

It is an ecosystem.

At first glance, it looks like a typical Golgari self-mill strategy — cards go to the graveyard, creatures come back, value happens. But this deck takes the Descend mechanic to its logical extreme by committing almost entirely to permanents. If it isn’t a land, creature, artifact, or enchantment… it probably didn’t make the cut.

There is exactly **one** nonpermanent in the deck — and it’s here only because it has dredge.

That choice is intentional.

When your interaction, your ramp, your card advantage, and your threats are all permanents, every piece of your deck feeds the same mycelial network. Removal isn’t just removal. Sacrifice isn’t just utility. It’s all descent. It’s all nutrient flow.

A large graveyard looks scary. But this deck doesn’t win because the graveyard is big.

It wins because the graveyard is alive.

## Keywords

- **Descend** — _You descend each time a permanent card is put into your graveyard from anywhere._
- **Mill** — _Put the top N cards of your library into your graveyard._
- **Dredge** — _If you would draw a card, you may instead mill cards equal to the dredge number. If you do, return the dredge card from your graveyard to your hand._

# The Commander

[[The Mycotyrant]] is a trampling Elder Fungus whose power and toughness are equal to the number of Fungi and/or Saprolings you control.

At the end of your turn, it creates X 1/1 black Fungus creature tokens that can’t block, where X is the number of times you descended that turn.

Read that carefully.

It doesn’t care how big your graveyard is.

It cares how much you *fed* it.

Every fetchland.  
Every sacrifice.  
Every mill.  
Every dredge.

Each one is a pulse through the mycelium.

Even if [[The Mycotyrant]] dies, the colony barely notices. Recast it and it immediately counts the board you already cultivated. In fact, the act of dying often increases its size — one more permanent (itself) descended into the soil.

The Mycotyrant starts small, but it scales with your cultivation. And once you are descending consistently, it becomes very difficult to meaningfully prune.

# The Gameplan

## Early Game — Begin the Rot

The early turns are about quiet colonization.

Cast [[The Mycotyrant]] as soon as you can and begin descending every turn. Even two or three triggers per turn will begin to spore outward. The board presence builds slowly at first — just a few Fungi each end step.

You want permanents entering the graveyard immediately — fetchlands, sacrifices, self-mill, discard. Good early examples include:

- [[Ash Barrens]] — Cycling descends
- [[Evolving Wilds]] — Sacrificing descends
- [[Broodheart Engine]] — Surveil descends
- [[Millikin]] — Mill descends

None of these look explosive.

That’s the point.

A few cards in the graveyard rarely scare anyone. A couple 1/1 Fungi look harmless.

But you are not trying to shock the table.

You are establishing a growth pattern.

Once the colony is rooted, the rest of the game becomes inevitability through accumulation. Not big turns — steady expansion.

---

## Mid Game — Composted Value

By now, your graveyard is stocked.

This is where it stops looking like a pile and starts functioning like rich soil.

Recursion engines like [[Kagha, Shadow Archdruid]], [[Meren of Clan Nel Toth]], and [[Deadbridge Chant]] ensure that milling isn’t chaotic.

It’s cyclical.

You don’t care *which* permanent went to the graveyard — only that enough organic matter accumulated. The deck is built so that almost anything coming back is productive.

Lands pile up naturally, turning [[Conduit of Worlds]], [[Hedge Shredder]], and [[World Shaper]] into explosive ramp tools. A mid-game [[World Shaper]] death doesn’t just recover lands. It triggers a surge of growth across the entire board.

Opponents often look at the graveyard and see randomness.

What they miss is density.

What they miss is redundancy.

What they miss is that every board wipe only increases the nutrient layer.

## Late Game — Full Bloom

The late game doesn’t explode.

It overgrows.

### Fungal Voltron

Sometimes [[The Mycotyrant]] becomes impossibly large. With trample and a battlefield full of Fungi, commander damage becomes difficult to prevent.

Graveyard-scaled threats like [[Sewer Nemesis]], [[Splinterfright]], and [[Old Stickfingers]] reinforce this pressure. Combat stops being about surprise and starts being about suffocation.

### Death as Fuel

Alternatively, your Fungi become compost.

With [[Syr Konrad, the Grim]], [[Dreadhound]], or [[Funeral Room]] on the battlefield, sacrificing creatures converts incremental board presence into life drain.

[[Skullclamp]], [[Vampiric Rites]], and [[Nemata, Primeval Warden]] transform bodies into cards, mana, and continued spread.

Board wipes begin to resemble seasonal die-offs — dramatic, but temporary. The mold returns thicker.

One particularly brutal sequence pairs [[Dreadhound]] with [[Massacre Girl]]. The cascading death triggers can empty life totals without a single combat step.

### Bio Overrun

Yes, [[Craterhoof Behemoth]] can end a game immediately.  
Yes, [[Awakening Hall]] can refill a battlefield overnight.

But those are compounders.

Most games end because opponents exhaust their answers long before you exhaust your biomass.

# Strategies

## Dredge — Feeding the Colony

Dredge isn’t just recursion here.

It’s propagation.

Because nearly every card in the deck is a permanent, dredging transforms card draws into multiple descents. Each dredge represents:

- More organic matter in the graveyard
- More end step Fungi
- A larger [[The Mycotyrant]]

You aren’t digging for a combo.

You’re thickening the mycelium.

Always check your graveyard before you draw. Sometimes the correct line isn’t another card in hand — it’s another layer of growth beneath the surface.

---

## Combat and the Nature of Fungi

Your Fungus tokens cannot block.

That is not a weakness.

It is evolutionary design.

They exist to attack, to be sacrificed, or to decay productively.

Sometimes the correct play is to swing with [[The Mycotyrant]] and every Fungus you control.

Opponents face uncomfortable decisions:

- Block the trampling commander?
- Or absorb a wave of small attackers?

If they block the Fungi, your drain pieces suck their life.
If they take the damage, life totals shrink anyway.

And assuming you’ve been descending, [[The Mycotyrant]] will repopulate much of what was lost at the next end step.

You are not preserving spores.

You are releasing them.

---

## The Mycelial Network

This deck operates mostly at sorcery speed.

That constraint is intentional.

Permanent-based interaction ensures that your removal, recursion, and pressure all contribute to descent. You are rarely holding up reactive instants. You are embedding influence into the battlefield itself.

You rarely react.

You spread.

## [[Illicit Masquerade]] — The Anti-Boardwipe

Board wipes are supposed to reset creature decks.

This card turns them into mulch.

With Flash, [[Illicit Masquerade]] lets you respond to a wipe and put an imposter counter on each creature you control.

When they die, each one triggers:

> “Exile it. Return up to one other target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.”

Because all of your creatures — including tokens — die simultaneously, each one creates its own trigger. Those triggers can be stacked so that you return creatures from your graveyard before their own triggers resolve, making them illegal targets to exile.

In practice, this often means:

- The board dies.
- Your graveyard blooms onto the battlefield.
- The colony continues uninterrupted.

Opponents believe they cleared the infestation.

In reality, they enriched it.

# Summary

The Fungi is a deck about resilience.

It does not rely on a single permanent.  
It does not rely on a single line.  
It does not rely on spectacle.

It relies on recurrence.

Every permanent in the graveyard is latent growth.  
Every death thickens the mold.  
Every board wipe deepens the soil.

What begins as a few harmless 1/1 Fungi becomes an entrenched ecosystem that is remarkably difficult to sterilize.

This is not Golgari as apocalypse.

It is Golgari as mycosis.

Slow.  
Persistent.  
Unavoidable.

Welcome to the colony.
