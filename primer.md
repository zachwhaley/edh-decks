# Introduction

**The Fungi** is not just a graveyard deck.

It is an ecosystem.

At first glance, it looks like a typical Golgari self-mill strategy — cards go to the graveyard, creatures come back, value happens. But this deck takes the Descend mechanic to its logical extreme by committing almost entirely to permanents. If it isn’t a land, creature, artifact, or enchantment... it probably didn’t make the cut.

There is exactly **one** nonpermanent in the deck — and it’s here only because it has dredge.

We are not protecting our library.  
We are cultivating it.

Every permanent that hits the graveyard is not a loss. It’s fertilizer.

## Keywords

- **Mill** — _Put the top N cards of your library into your graveyard._
- **Descend** — _You descend each time a permanent card is put into your graveyard from anywhere._
- **Dredge** — _If you would draw a card, you may instead mill cards equal to the dredge number. If you do, return the dredge card from your graveyard to your hand._

# The Commander

[[The Mycotyrant]] is a trampling Elder Fungus whose power and toughness are equal to the number of Fungi and/or Saprolings you control.

At the end of your turn, The Mycotyrant creates X 1/1 black Fungus creature tokens that can’t block, where X is the number of times you descended that turn.

Read that carefully.

It doesn’t care how big your graveyard is.

It cares how much you *used* it.

Every fetchland.  
Every sacrifice.  
Every self-mill trigger.  
Every dredge.

Each one is a spore released into the battlefield.

Even if you cast The Mycotyrant at the end of your turn, it enters with the power and toughness of every Fungi/Saproling on the board.  This also means that if The Mycotyrant is removed, you can recast it that same turn, returning it with the same power and toughness, oh and plus one because it itself went to the graveyard before the command zone. 

The Mycotyrant starts off small, but it never stays small for long. The moment permanents start hitting the graveyard, the infestation begins to spread.

And once it spreads, it multiplies quickly.

## A Word on Dredge

Dredge isn't just a draw replacement, or recursion in this deck.

It is acceleration.

Because nearly every card in the deck is a permanent, dredging turns every draw into multiple descents, which in turn creates more Fungi. You aren’t just refilling your hand — you’re building your future board.

Always check your graveyard before drawing.

# The Gameplan

## Early Game — Start the Rot

The early turns are about subtle growth.

You want permanents entering the graveyard as soon as possible — fetchlands, sacrifice outlets, self-mill, discard, anything that begins the descent.

You don’t look threatening yet. A few cards in the graveyard rarely scare anyone.

That’s fine.

Cast [[The Mycotyrant]] as soon as it’s safe and begin descending every turn. Even two or three triggers per turn will snowball quickly. The board presence builds quietly at first — just a few Fungi here and there.

The table often doesn’t react until it’s too late.

## Mid Game — Growth and Recycling

By now, your graveyard is stocked.

This is where the deck shifts from “value” to “inevitability.”

Recursion engines like [[Journey to Eternity // Atzal, Cave of Eternity]], [[Meren of Clan Nel Toth]], and [[Deadbridge Chant]] ensure that nothing truly stays dead. Milling stops feeling random and starts feeling curated.

Lands will inevitably pile up in the graveyard as well — which turns cards like [[Conduit of Worlds]], [[Hedge Shredder]], and [[World Shaper]] into explosive ramp tools. A mid-game World Shaper death can feel like casting a one-sided Genesis Wave for lands.

Board wipes begin to look less like threats and more like events.

With [[Syr Konrad, the Grim]], [[Funeral Room]], and [[Moldervine Reclamation]] in play, every death becomes value. Opponents are forced into uncomfortable decisions:

- Kill your board and take damage?
- Leave it alone and let it grow?

Either choice benefits you.

## End Game — Consume and Assimilate

The endgame doesn’t arrive suddenly.

It spreads.

### Fungal Voltron

Sometimes [[The Mycotyrant]] is simply enormous. With trample and a battlefield full of Fungi, commander damage becomes a very real threat. Pair that with graveyard-scaled creatures like [[Sewer Nemesis]], [[Splinterfright]], and [[Old Stickfingers]], and combat math becomes miserable for your opponents.

### Aristocrats Spiral

Alternatively, your Fungi become fuel.

With [[Syr Konrad, the Grim]], [[Dreadhound]], or [[Funeral Room]] on the field, sacrificing a handful of tokens can chunk the table dramatically. Tools like [[Skullclamp]], [[Vampiric Rites]], and [[Nemata, Primeval Warden]] turn those bodies into cards, mana, and inevitability.

One particularly brutal sequence pairs [[Dreadhound]] with [[Massacre Girl]]. The chain reaction of death triggers can end the game without ever entering combat.

### Overrun the World

And sometimes, you don’t need subtlety.

[[Craterhoof Behemoth]] turns spores into a stampede.  
[[Awakening Hall]] refills the battlefield in a single swing.  
[[Mycoloth]] doubles down on token production and demands an answer.

If the table has allowed you to keep a graveyard and a board, the game will end decisively.

## Playing the Puzzle

This deck plays almost entirely at sorcery speed.

That constraint is intentional.

You must constantly decide:

- Do I commit more to the board?
- Do I hold back in case of a wipe?
- Do I dredge for descend or draw naturally?

You rarely “react.”  
You advance.

The deck rewards patience and sequencing. It thrives when the table underestimates it — when your graveyard looks messy instead of lethal.

## Card Highlight

### [[Illicit Masquerade]]

Board wipes are supposed to reset creature decks.

This card turns them into compost.

Because it has Flash, you can respond to a board wipe and put an imposter counter on each of your creatures.

When they die, each creature with an imposter counter triggers:

> “Exile it. Return up to one other target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.”

At first glance, it looks like all of your creatures are just going to get exiled, right?

Nope.

Each creature — including your Fungus tokens — creates its own trigger. Those triggers can be stacked so that you return creatures from your graveyard before their own triggers resolve.

Since you usually have more triggers than creatures in your graveyard, you can bring back everything that died… and often more.

The table thinks they’ve cleared the infestation.

In reality, they’ve fed it.

# Summary

The Fungi is a deck about inevitability.

It doesn’t explode out of nowhere. It accumulates.

Every permanent in the graveyard is future material. Every death is value. Every board wipe is fertilizer. What begins as a few harmless 1/1 tokens becomes a swelling ecosystem that is difficult to meaningfully disrupt.

This is Golgari at its most thematic: life from death, growth from decay, inevitability from patience.

If you enjoy engines over explosives, attrition over flash, and the quiet satisfaction of watching your board grow while your opponents debate whether they should have stopped you three turns ago — then welcome to the infestation.
