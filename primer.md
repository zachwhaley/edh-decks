# Introduction

**The Fungi** is not just a graveyard deck.

It is an ecosystem.

At first glance, it looks like a typical Golgari self-mill strategy — cards go to the graveyard, creatures come back, value happens. But this deck takes the Descend mechanic to its logical extreme by committing almost entirely to permanents. If it isn’t a land, creature, artifact, or enchantment... it probably didn’t make the cut.

There is exactly **one** nonpermanent in the deck — and it’s here only because it has dredge.

That choice is intentional.

When your interaction, your ramp, your card advantage, and your threats are all permanents, every piece of your deck feeds the same engine. Removal isn’t just removal. Sacrifice isn’t just utility. It’s all descent.

A large graveyard looks scary. But this deck doesn’t win because the graveyard is big.

It wins because the graveyard is active.

## Keywords

- **Descend** — _You descend each time a permanent card is put into your graveyard from anywhere._
- **Mill** — _Put the top N cards of your library into your graveyard._
- **Dredge** — _If you would draw a card, you may instead mill cards equal to the dredge number. If you do, return the dredge card from your graveyard to your hand._

# The Commander

[[The Mycotyrant]] is a trampling Elder Fungus whose power and toughness are equal to the number of Fungi and/or Saprolings you control.

At the end of your turn, it creates X 1/1 black Fungus creature tokens that can’t block, where X is the number of times you descended that turn.

Read that carefully.

It doesn’t care how big your graveyard is.

It cares how often you *used* it.

Every fetchland.  
Every sacrifice.  
Every mill.  
Every dredge.

Each one becomes board presence.

Even if [[The Mycotyrant]] dies, the ecosystem barely flinches. Recast it and it immediately counts the board you already built. In fact, the act of dying often increases its size — one more permanent (itself) descended.

The Mycotyrant starts small, but it scales with your habits (NOTE find a different word). And once you are descending consistently, it becomes very difficult to meaningfully shrink.

# The Gameplan

## Early Game — Begin the Rot

The early turns are about subtle growth.

Cast [[The Mycotyrant]] as soon as you can and begin descending every turn. Even two or three triggers per turn will snowball (NOTE find a more thematic word). The board presence builds slowly at first — just a few Fungi each turn.

You want permanents entering the graveyard immediately — fetchlands, sacrifice outlets, self-mill, discard. Good early examples include:

- [[Ash Barrens]] - Cycling descends
- [[Evolving Wilds]] - Sacrificing descends
- [[Broodheart Engine]] - Surveil descends
- [[Millikin]] - Mill descends

None of these look explosive.

That’s the point.

A few cards in the graveyard rarely scare anyone. A couple 1/1 Fungi look harmless.

But you are not trying to spike the table.

You are trying to normalize the growth.

Once that rhythm is established, the rest of the game becomes arithmetic (NOTE find better word).

## Mid Game — Composted Value

By now, your graveyard is stocked.

This is where the graveyard shifts from a "pile" to "value".

Recursion engines like [[Journey to Eternity // Atzal, Cave of Eternity]], [[Meren of Clan Nel Toth]], and [[Deadbridge Chant]] ensure that milling isn’t chaotic.

It’s recyclable.

You don’t care *which* permanent went to the graveyard — only that enough of them did. The deck is built so that almost anything coming back is productive.

Lands pile up naturally, turning [[Conduit of Worlds]], [[Hedge Shredder]], and [[World Shaper]] into explosive ramp tools. A mid-game [[World Shaper]] death doesn’t just recover lands. It accelerates the entire ecosystem.

## End Game — Relentless Pressure (NOTE needs to be more thematic)

The endgame doesn’t arrive suddenly.

It spreads.

### Fungal Voltron

Sometimes [[The Mycotyrant]] is simply enormous. With trample and a battlefield full of Fungi, commander damage becomes a very real threat.

Graveyard-scaled threats like [[Sewer Nemesis]], [[Splinterfright]], and [[Old Stickfingers]] reinforce this pressure. Combat becomes less about surprise and more about inevitability.

### Death as Fuel

Alternatively, your Fungi become fuel.

With [[Syr Konrad, the Grim]], [[Dreadhound]], or [[Funeral Room]] on the battlefield, sacrificing creatures turns incremental board presence into life drain.

[[Skullclamp]], [[Vampiric Rites]], and [[Nemata, Primeval Warden]] convert bodies into cards, mana, and inevitability.

Board wipes begin to look less like threats and more like payoffs.

Opponents are forced into awkward choices:

- Kill your board and take damage?
- Leave it alone and let it grow?

Either choice benefits you.

One particularly brutal sequence pairs [[Dreadhound]] with [[Massacre Girl]]. The chain reaction of death triggers can end the game without ever entering combat.

### Closing Without Drama (NOTE needs better words)

And sometimes, you don’t need subtlety.

[[Craterhoof Behemoth]] turns spores into a stampede.  
[[Awakening Hall]] refills the battlefield in a single swing.  

But those often just let you "win more".

Most games end because opponents ran out of clean answers long before you ran out of material.

# Strategies

## Dredge

Dredge isn’t just recursion here.

It’s velocity.

Because nearly every card in the deck is a permanent, dredging transforms draws into multiple descents. Each dredge is functionally:

- More graveyard resources
- More end step Fungi
- A larger commander

You aren’t digging for a combo piece.

You’re increasing pressure while stockpiling resilience.

Always check your graveyard before you draw. Sometimes the correct line isn’t more cards in hand — it’s more permanents in motion.

## Combat and the Nature of Fungi

Your Fungus tokens cannot block.

That is not a drawback.

It is design.

They exist to attack, to be sacrificed, or to die profitably.

Sometimes the correct play is to swing with The Mycotyrant and all your Fungi.

Opponents are often forced into uncomfortable blocks:

- Stop the trampling [[The Mycotyrant]]?
- Or absorb a wave of small attackers?

Either choice advances your position.

And assuming you've been descending, The Mycotyrant will repopulate many Fungi you lost in combat.

## The Engine Room (NOTE needs better name)

This deck operates mostly at sorcery speed.

That constraint is intentional.

Permanent-based interaction means your removal, recursion, and pressure all contribute to descend. You are rarely holding up reactive instants. You are committing to board presence that continues working even after removal.

You rarely react.

You advance.

## [[Illicit Masquerade]]

Board wipes are supposed to reset creature decks.

This card turns them into compost.

With Flash, [[Illicit Masquerade]] lets you respond to a wipe and put an imposter counter on each creature you control.

When they die, each one triggers:

> “Exile it. Return up to one other target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.”

At first glance, it looks like all of your creatures are just going to get exiled, right?

Nope.

Because all of your creatures — including tokens — die simultaneously, each one creates its own trigger. Those triggers can be stacked so that you return creatures from your graveyard before their own triggers resolve.

In practice, this often means:

- The board dies.
- Your graveyard empties onto the battlefield.
- Your ecosystem continues.

Opponents believe they cleared the infestation.

In reality, they’ve fed it.

# Summary

The Fungi is a deck about resilience.

It does not rely on a single permanent.  
It does not rely on a single line.  
It does not rely on surprise.

It relies on repetition.

Every permanent in the graveyard is potential energy.  
Every death advances the system.  

What begins as a few harmless 1/1 Fungi becomes a swelling ecosystem that is difficult to disrupt.

This is not Golgari as apocalypse.

It is Golgari as ecology.

If you enjoy engines over explosives, attrition over flash, and the quiet satisfaction of watching your board grow while your opponents debate whether they should have stopped you three turns ago — then welcome to the infestation.
