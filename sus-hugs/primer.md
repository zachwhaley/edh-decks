# Introduction

**Sus Hugs** is a group hug deck that uses symmetrical card draw and goading to control the battlefield both politically and literally.

## Keywords

- **Suspect** — _A suspected creature has menace and can't block._
- **Menace** — _This creature can't be blocked except by two or more creatures._
- **Goad** — _Until your next turn, that creature attacks each combat if able and attacks a player other than you if able._

# The Commander

[[Nelly Borca, Impulsive Accuser]] is a red/white 2/4 vigilant commander who rewards you and another player with a card draw whenever that player hits someone **other than you** with combat damage.

She fuels this effect by **suspecting** creatures when she attacks, then **goading** all suspected creatures—forcing them to attack, and with **menace** to boot!

And because suspected creatures **can’t block**, Nelly’s attack trigger can also double as a tool to remove pesky blockers.

## The Lieutenant 

[[Agrus Kos, Spirit of Justice]] is your second-in-commander working alongside Nelly to throw suspicion around and permanently detain suspicious creatures that get in your way.

Agrus is a 2/4 double-striking, vigilant spirit who either **suspects** a creature or **exiles** a suspected creature when he enters or attacks—giving Nelly another target to goad with her attack trigger.  And because his ability says, **“Choose up to one target creature. If it's suspected, exile it,”** and not just “Exile target suspected creature,” he and Nelly can tag-team to suspect and exile any creature in a single combat step.

Here’s how it works:

Declare Nelly and Agrus as attackers, triggering both of their abilities. Let Nelly’s trigger resolve first, suspecting a creature. Then resolve Agrus’s ability, choosing the newly suspected creature to exile it from the battlefield.

# The Gameplan

## Early Game — Be inconspicuous

Use catchup ramp cards like [[Loyal Warhound]], [[Claim Jumper]], and [[Smuggler's Share]] to keep up with the ramping decks.  Catchup ramp is less conspicuous than a Rampant Growth and will keep people from looking too much at your mana base.

Focus on making allies by using symmetrical draw spells like [[Humble Defector]], [[Tenuous Truce]], and [[Secret Rendezvous]] to hand out cards for free.  Try to pick the player that isn't doing as well to give cards to—they may become an important ally later.

## Mid Game — Control the battlefield

Cast Nelly and begin conservatively goading creatures each turn—using cards like [[Whispersilk Cloak]], [[Access Tunnel]], and [[Reconnaissance]] to help her attack safely and consistently trigger her ability. Pair this with goad spells like [[Shiny Impetus]], [[Bloodthirsty Blade]], and [[Vengeful Ancestor]]. This helps redirect attacks away from you as your political capital starts to run dry. Just be careful not to goad too aggressively, or you might attract more heat than you can handle.

As an alternative to goading, you can also play "deterrent" cards like [[Ghostly Prison]], [[Boros Reckoner]], or [[Kazuul, Tyrant of the Cliffs]].  These serve the same purpose of preventing opponents from attacking you, while giving them a sense of agency over their attacks—albeit a false one.

Either way, opponents landing attacks against each other draws you more cards, which lets you dig for the big finishers.

## End Game — Let them fight!

This is the trickiest and, frankly, the most fun part of the deck.  Winning with this deck is a test of strategy, timing, and a bit of luck.

Because **goad** says _a creature attacks each combat if able **and attacks a player other than you if able**_, if there are no other players at the table to attack besides you, then goaded creatures _have_ to attack you!  This means you are very likely to lose a one-on-one fight with another player, hence you need to play your cards and make your moves such that when there are only 2 of you left, the other player is tapped out and wide open.

So, leading up to this fated standoff, you need to do your best to keep the other players hitting each other over and over again with [[Disrupt Decorum]], [[Taunt from the Rampart]], and [[Geode Rager]].  And make those hits HARD with [[Duelist's Heritage]], [[Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion]], and [[Gisela, Blade of Goldnight]]—FYI, double strike means double draw!

Finally, it's time for the [[Spectacular Showdown|mkc]]!—literally.  This card can win you the game with all players still alive.  Cast it for its overload cost and watch as your remaining opponents reluctantly destroy each other leaving a single opponent remaining, tapped out and wide open for your creatures to finish them off.

Or if your opponents aren't keen to kill each other, perhaps their creatures will be with an [[Insurrection]]—grab their creatures, and send them in for the final blow!

[[Take the Bait]] is another sneaky finisher—especially devastating if their creatures are already goaded.

And if the above doesn't cut it, wipe the board with [[Split Up]], [[Austere Command]], or [[Promise of Loyalty]] and beat them down before they can rebuild.

# Summary

At its core, Sus Hugs is a political control deck disguised as a friendly group hug strategy. It starts the game with generous gifts, but as the table grows comfortable with your presence, you quietly begin seeding chaos: suspecting creatures, goading threats away from you, and subtly reshaping the battlefield.

This deck thrives on indirect influence. Victory comes not through overwhelming force, but through timing, misdirection, and a well-executed final blow. Whether you steal the win from the jaws of a table-wide brawl or quietly emerge the last player standing, every game feels like political theater—and you’re both the playwright and the survivor.

If you enjoy a challenge, love clever interactions, and want a deck that rewards reading the room more than brute strength, then Sus Hugs is ready to bring joy, suspicion, and just the right amount of betrayal to your next Commander night.
